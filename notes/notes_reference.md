# Brainstorming for prelim meeting with Sharon

Three parts of venn diagram from before.

Theme: Synthetic Intelligence/designed intelligence
1) Information: entropy, storage, retrieval
2) Biomimicry: pluripotency, complex signaling capabilities, CRISPR-like error correction
3) Non-equilibrium systems: agent-based models (minimal models), collection motion


Information storage, retrieval, and action

- Reconfigurability
- How do we embed information in a material?
- How can we embed reconfigurability in a material?
- What information is already embedded in a material building block's properties?

Shape memory materials have a dual-domain system, in which one is always elastic (the elastic domain), while the other (the transition domain) is able to change its stiffness remarkably if a right stimulus is presented.

"The material is the machine": super cool, [here](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/307/5706/53/tab-pdf)

This review addresses recent developments in actively moving materials based on stimuli-responsive polymers on the scale from single molecules to polymer networks. The examples of application of stimuli-responsive polymers for design of actuators, sensors, active elements in microfluidic devices, materials with switchable optical properties as well as biomaterials are discussed.

### Older notes
Sharon’s suggestion: reconfigurability
 
What world do I envision?
Colloidal robotics:
            Encode information in wet computing
Leverage self-assembly trends to enable particles to run on their own accord—imagine that we could build engineer particles, not just materials, backwards—say that we want this behavior, what shape do we need to do this?
 
Previous work to build off of
Lock and key binding (paper showing different kinetic pathways)
Allophilic shaping—used to improve the self-assembly of desired phases without the use of functionalization external fields, or other types of intrinsic inter-particle interactions
Digital colloids, wet computing

The components of entropy generation in non-equilibrium systems is a fundamental hard problem

Thoughts:
	- Block copolymers phase separate so that similar sides of the strand are in a band-- what would happen with anisotropic shapes where each side would typically have a very different behavior?
