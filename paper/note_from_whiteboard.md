Question: What additional information can I add to a system to achieve a specific outcome?
We can think of information here as the amount of complexity

- What do we mean by information? - relative rather than absolute
  - minimal ingredients for max complexity-- optimization between specificity of input versus Output
  - how to quantify?
  - moving between systems-- ratios for scaling?
  - sample system--> Paul's folding nets
- Application: pathway engineering
  - revisit Archimedean tilings paper-- how much additional information "kick" is needed to get over assembly humps?
