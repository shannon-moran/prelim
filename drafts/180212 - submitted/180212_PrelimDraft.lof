Sequential operations are very deterministic and can be carried out by automated robotic equipment, but even so are heavily process intensive and require many individual assembly steps. One-pot systems can be fully computationally defined, though in practice are heavily sequence intensive and be subjected to errors more readily than in molecular- scale systems when accounting for kinetic and thermodynamics of packing larger objects and materials. A hierarchical assembly methodology offers a hybrid approach of both strategies, where a sequential addition of structures preformed in a one-pot setup provide the desired 3D material organization.}}{6}{figure.2}
