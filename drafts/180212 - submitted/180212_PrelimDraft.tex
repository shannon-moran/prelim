\section{Previous work}

The research proposed above utilizes a different system from my work to date.
While the proposed research looks at the interplay of folding geometry and non-specific attractions on equilibrium assembly, I previously studied the role of hard particle shape interactions in an actively driven system. 
Consistent in this research is an interest in understanding, and characterizing, the role of particle interactions on self-assembly.
Below is excerpted from an in-preparation paper detailing the role of anisotropy on self-assembly in active systems \cite{Moran_2018_unpublished}.

\section{Conclusions and potential impact}

The proposed research seeks to fill a gap in the self-assembly literature: what is the minimal amount of instruction we need to give a system for it to assemble a target structure?
Recent work has shown that the interaction specificity seen in DNA-mediated addressable assembly is not specific to DNA systems \cite{Reinhardt_2014_PRL}, and that synthetic systems can replicate interaction specificity achieved by nature \cite{Huntley_2016_PNAS}.
While addressable assembly from a synthetic DNA analog has not been shown yet, an experimental realization is not far along the research horizon.
However, a core question that will need to be answered is: how much instruction will this system need to provide to successfully assemble its target structure?

The work in this PhD research proposal seeks to provide an approach and metric to answer that question. See Figure \ref{fig:gantt} for key tasks and milestones.

%Ultimately, tailoring self-assembly and addressable complexity are driven by the question:
%
%\begin{center}How do I give particles in my system sufficient information to find their proper position in a target whole?\end{center}
%
%In systems targeting particular structures, tailored attraction (experimentally via single-stranded DNA or theoretically via an attractive potential) and repulsion can be used to tailor the structure of particle assembly.
%In systems targeting addressable complexity with DNA origami and protein folding, such instruction can be given with exact detail through genetic code.
%Work by Brenner and Manoharan has sought to quantify the amount of specificity bonds in such systems can contain, and the limits on target system complexity given differing bond informations.
%
%However, missing in this conversation is a measure of the importance of each individual interaction on the emergent behavior of the whole system.
%I intend to contribute in part during the remainder of my PhD.
%Instead of simply observing emergent behavior as an outcome of specifically-designed behavior of individuals, we could instead engineer such behavior as a quantifiable outcome of the interaction of an information-rich network of agents.
%Having such knowledge may allow us to embed multiple ``states'' in a material, such as the minimum folds to move between two target origami structures \cite{An_2011_Robotica}.
%Being able to measure, and ultimately control, the assembly instructions stored in a starting material is a critical step to enabling materials by design and advancing materials science.
