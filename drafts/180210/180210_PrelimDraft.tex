\section{Conclusions and potential impact}

Ultimately, tailoring self-assembly and addressable complexity are driven by the question:

\begin{center}How do I give particles in my system sufficient information to find their proper position in a target whole?\end{center}

In systems targeting particular structures, tailored attraction (experimentally via single-stranded DNA or theoretically via an attractive potential) and repulsion can be used to tailor the structure of particle assembly.
In systems targeting addressable complexity with DNA origami and protein folding, such direction can be given with exact detail through genetic code.
Work by Brenner and Manoharan has sought to quantify the amount of specificity bonds in such systems can contain, and the limits on target system complexity given differing bond informations.

However, missing in this conversation is a measure of the importance of each individual interaction on the emergent behavior of the whole system.
I intend to contribute in part during the remainder of my PhD.
Instead of simply observing emergent behavior as an outcome of specifically-designed behavior of individuals, we could instead engineer such behavior as a quantifiable outcome of the interaction of an information-rich network of agents.
Having such knowledge may allow us to embed multiple ``states'' in a material, such as the minimum folds to move between two target origami structures \cite{An_2011_Robotica}.
Being able to measure, and ultimately control, the assembly directions stored in a starting material is a critical step to enabling materials by design and advancing materials science.
