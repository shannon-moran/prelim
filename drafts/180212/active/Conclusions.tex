\section*{Discussion and conclusions}

While the nature of the densest packing in equilibrium can be used to explain the collective behavior seen under activity, further work is needed to elucidate the link between equilibrium packing (or assembly) and non-equilibrium assembly.

Finally, one may argue that the clusters observed here are kinetic packings, rather than thermodynamic self-assembled states.
As the thermodynamics of active matter continues to develop, establishing the phase behavior of active assemblies (or packings) will be of intense interest as directed, non-equilibrium self-assembly is developed.
