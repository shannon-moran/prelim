\section{Introduction and motivation (1pg)}
% Statement of the problem, purpose and significance of the research


Thesis: Reconfigurability-induced switching of a material's structure could be explored as a way of storing information (``memory'') in a material. We can consider this pluripotency.

Goal: Predictively and reliably encode information in materials systems. (I know this is too broad)

Problem statement:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Engineering}: Designing functional, reconfigurable materials will require some method of storing information in a material-- we might call this ``memory''
\item \textit{Science}: Understanding how to ``store information'' in a material that embeds a response is a fundamental problem; further understanding the linkage between information-theoretic entropy and thermodynamic entropy concepts (accessible states, heat) could further our understand of dynamics of biological, etc processes
\end{itemize}


Ideas:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reconfigurable systems may be the key for unlocking adaptive material applications
\item At a particle level, we can think of this as building pluripotent building blocks that contain some response to a stimulus
\item At a system level, we can think of this as having metastable configurations in response to some stimulus
\item At an assembly-level, we can think of this as building blocks that can be engineered to form specifically-ordered arrays
\end{itemize}


Key line from Simons proposal: ``A coherent framework of thermodynamic and non-equilibrium processes seen through information theoretic eyes could lead to new theories for encoding information in matter-- which would allow for the design of novel materials and novel material behavioral control.''

\section{Background - Research already completed (2-3 pg)}
\subsection{Role of particle shape on the emergent behavior of active systems}
Take selections from in-preparation paper.

\textbf{Relation to proposed thesis topic}: If we define information broadly as any quality of a building block that impacts the emergent behavior of a system of those particles (in this case, force direction and shape), then we can argue this work is looking at a few aspects of information in active systems.

\subsection{Mention work on NSF grant proposal?}
Using DNA-mediated assembly to store information in nanoparticle arrays. 

\section{Description of proposed research (7-8 pg, 2-3 pg per aim)}
% Including method or approach and expected difficulties
% This must constitute about 50\% of the text of the written proposal: 7-8 pages
% Clear statement of the work to be undertaken and must include:
% Objectives for the period of the proposed work and expected significance
% Relation to the present state of knowledge in the field and to work in progress at Michigan/elsewhere
% Expected research program sequence
% Decision points expected during the course of the research
% Methods of data reduction, evaluation, interpretation and presentation

High-level: ``Information'' are those factors that impact the yield and kinetics of self-assembly. To engineer them, we must continue to understand them.

Need to figure out what angle I want to approach this from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pathway engineering?
\item``Smart''particle building blocks?
\item Algorithmically-designed interactions/patterned structures?
\item ... something else?
\end{itemize}

For each aim:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal and significance
\item Hypothesis
\item Approach, methods, analysis to be used (including relevant citations)
\end{itemize}

\section{Time table}
% Basically a Gantt chart
\textit{Will put together a Gantt chart with associated milestones through 2020.}

\section{Conclusion}
Long, long-term goal: Instead of simply observing emergent behavior as an outcome of collective motion of individuals, we could instead engineer such behavior as a quantifiable outcome of the interaction of an information-rich network of agents.
