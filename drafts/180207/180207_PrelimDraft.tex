``Information'' are those factors that impact the yield and kinetics of self-assembly (thermodynamics of the free energy landscape and the kinetics of the path to get to a target structure from a given starting point).

Specifically, as we look to both understand how nature governs self-assembly into target structures, we need a language to understand this.
Nature is very good at already picking an optimized route through a free energy landscape \cite{Jacobs_2016_BiophysicalJournal}.

\subsection{What I want to accomplish in my thesis}


1) Define a measure of pathway information. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item We already have ways of measuring how good a particular bond is
\item Are there particular bonds/connections that are the most important to get correct to enable forming the desired final structure?
\item  
\end{itemize}



2) Use that measure of pathway information to design ideal pre-cursors for target structures. \\



3) Attempt to use machine learning to predict ideal pre-cursors for given target structures. \\
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{Long_2014_JPhysChemB}: Nonlinear Machine Learning of Patchy Colloid Self-Assembly Pathways and Mechanisms out of the Furguson group
\end{itemize}


4) Why is it important we find the ``most important'' pathway points? from \cite{Stern_2017_arxiv} \\
How then can self-folding origami be folded with a
minimal number of actuators? A lesson can be drawn
from similar glassy landscape search problems in models
of protein folding (e.g., Levinthal?s paradox [17, 19, 20,
41]) and related NP-hard satisfiability (SAT) problems
[21, 42] that vary from the Traveling Salesman Problem
to Sudoku [43]. A common element in these satisfiability
problems is that random seeding of the search for
the global minimum leads to repeated backtracking after
reaching local minima, both in the context of computer
algorithms (as the DPLL algorithm for k-SAT [21]) or for
physical dynamics (as in protein folding) [42]. However,
careful seeding of the search - e.g., if the right boxes are
filled in first in Sudoku [43] or if the right parts of the protein
are folded first - can greatly reduce or even eliminate
backtracking [21] before reaching the global minimum.
Correct seeding is even more critical for origami since
folding is assumed to happen at ?zero temperature? (e.g.,
without any noise or fluctuations). As a result, the structure
cannot backtrack out of a local minimum as in the
case of non-zero temperature SAT problems [42].

This reference also has a really good introduction section relating origami and self-assembly \cite{Stern_2017_arxiv}.

\subsection{Paper 1, Role of particle shape on the emergent behavior of active systems: 2 pg}
2-3 pages of work already complete

\textbf{Relation to proposed thesis topic}: If we define information broadly as any quality of a building block that impacts the emergent behavior of a system of those particles (in this case, force direction and shape), then we can argue this work is looking at a few aspects of information in active systems.

See Figure \ref{fig:gantt} for key tasks and milestones through 2020, based on the projects outlined in the above sections.

\section{Conclusions and potential impact}
Long, long-term goal: Instead of simply observing emergent behavior as an outcome of collective motion of individuals, we could instead engineer such behavior as a quantifiable outcome of the interaction of an information-rich network of agents.
