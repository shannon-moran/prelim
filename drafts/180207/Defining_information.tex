\subsection{Paper 2 - Defining information as it pertains to colloidal systems - 2.5 pg}

% Including method or approach and expected difficulties
% This must constitute about 50\% of the text of the written proposal: 7-8 pages
% Clear statement of the work to be undertaken and must include:
% Objectives for the period of the proposed work and expected significance
% Relation to the present state of knowledge in the field and to work in progress at Michigan/elsewhere
% Expected research program sequence
% Decision points expected during the course of the research
% Methods of data reduction, evaluation, interpretation and presentation

Need to figure out what angle I want to approach this from:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pathway engineering?
\item``Smart''particle building blocks?
\item Algorithmically-designed interactions/patterned structures?
\item ... something else?
\end{itemize}


For each aim:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal and significance - paper introduction-esque, why is this worked needed in the conversation (citations)
\item Hypothesis
\item Approach, methods, analysis to be used (including relevant citations) - methods, how I'll go about this and what methods I'll need to develop
\end{itemize}
